            Baguio City, located in the northern part of the Philippines, has been grappling with pollution issues in recent years. 
            The city, known for its cool climate and lush greenery, has seen a rise in air pollution due to increasing vehicular traffic 
            and industrial activities. The high volume of vehicles on the roads, combined with inadequate public transportation and urban planning, 
            has resulted in congested roads and emissions from vehicles contributing to air pollution. Additionally, the city's growing population and 
            commercial activities have led to increased waste generation and improper waste disposal practices, resulting in pollution of the city's water 
            bodies and land. The combination of these factors has resulted in deteriorating air and water quality in Baguio City, posing health risks to its residents 
            and threatening the natural beauty that the city is known for. Addressing pollution in Baguio City requires comprehensive measures such as promoting sustainable 
            transportation, improving waste management practices, and increasing public awareness about the importance of environmental protection.
