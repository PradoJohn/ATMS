Advance Traffic Management Services Project

ATMS, which stands for Advanced Traffic Management Service, forms an integral part of Baguio City's Intelligent Transport System. This repository represents a web application prototype that incorporates fundamental CRUD operations and a basic conceptual model. The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the monitoring of traffic congestion in Baguio City. It serves as a valuable tool for numerous organizations, including the University of the Cordilleras, where I conducted my studies.
